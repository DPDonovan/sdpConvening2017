# Collaborative Coding and Reproducible Research
Generic repository we can use to both illustrate the use of the tools and store any/all code used to demo functionality or to create slide decks.  Everything will be fairly bare at first, but figured we could edit/update things in a single repository to show how distributed VCS tools enable all users to work on a project simultaneously without stepping on each others' toes.
