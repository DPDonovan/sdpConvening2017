# Session Pre Work
[Git](https://git-scm.com) definitely has some challenges associated with it, but we want to make sure that you don't have to deal with those challenges at convening as much as possible.  And the best part of all...we have swag for everyone who completes the prework.  

## What you need to do
1. The first thing you should do is make sure you've installed [Git](https://git-scm.com) on your machine.  We've provided links for the installers for several different platforms below so you won't even need to search for things.  Just click on the link that matches your operating system and processor type below and let the fun begin:
  * [Windows 32-bit](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.12.2.windows.2/Git-2.12.2.2-32-bit.exe)
  * [Windows 64-bit](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.12.2.windows.2/Git-2.12.2.2-64-bit.exe)
  * [Mac OSX](http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/git-2.10.1-intel-universal-mavericks.dmg/download?use_mirror=autoselect)
  * If you are working on a Linux or Unix system we've copied the commands you would need below:
    __Debian/Ubuntu__ - `apt-get install git`
    __Fedora (<= version 21)__ - `yum install git`
    __Fedora (>= version 22)__ - `dnf install git`
    __Gentoo__ - `emerge --ask --verbose dev-vcs/git`
    __Arch Linux__ - `pacman -S git`
    __openSUSE__ - `zypper install git`
    __Mageia__ - `urpmi git`
    __FreeBSD__ - `pkg install git`
    __Solaris v 9-11 (requires [OpenCSW](https://www.opencsw.org/)__ - `pkgutil -i git`
    __Solaris 11 Express__ - `pkg install developer/versioning/git`
    __OpenBSD__ - `pkg_add git`
    __Alpine__ - `apk add git`

2. Follow this link to create a [GitHub Account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
3. Once you've created and verified your account [click here](https://github.com/wbuchanan/sdpConvening2017/tree/prework) to get back to this page.
4. Fork the repository : ![Fork the repository](https://github.com/wbuchanan/sdpConvening2017/tree/prework/img/forkThisRepo.png]
5. If you're not on the prework branch already, you'll want to navigate to the pre-work branch: ![Branch Navigation]()
6. Next, click on the link for the file named `updateThisFile.md` in your fork of the repository.
7. Click on the pencil icon to edit the file : ![Edit File]()
8. Modify this file to let us know that you've completed the pre-work (there's only one more step to complete and it is pretty easy).  Find your name in the completed list.  It will look something like this when you are viewing the file to edit it:

`- [ ] Nathan Trenholm`
`- [ ] Daphne Jenkins`
`- [ ] Jason Becker`
`- [ ] Billy Buchanan`

To indicate that you've made it this far and to see how [Git](https://git-scm.com) can help you keep track of things, you'll put the letter `x` between the square brackets next to your name like this:

`- [ ] Nathan Trenholm`
`- [ ] Daphne Jenkins`
`- [ ] Jason Becker`
`- [x] Billy Buchanan`

10. Add a commit message letting us know how easy - _or not_ - it was to do this and commit the change to your repository : ![Commit Button and Message]()
11. This is the last step...click the button to submit a pull request : ![Pull Request Button]() and use this phrase for the message: `I can haz all the stickerz!`.
12. You're done.  __Congrats!__  You've installed [Git](https://git-scm.com), created a [GitHub](https://github.com) account, forked a repository, modified the code base, commited the change, and submitted a pull request.  


## HELP ME!!!
Some of you may have trouble completing the pre-work.  It's ok and with the possible exception of [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) everyone has run into some difficulty with [Git](https://git-scm.com) at some point.  But, you're not alone and we're here to help.  If this happens to you, you can click on [this link](https://github.com/wbuchanan/sdpConvening2017/issues/new) to ask us for help (and the best part is that you'll learn about issues at the same time).  Our goal is to make sure that we can make the most of the session time, so we want to help everyone get set up with any/every thing you'll need to be up and running before convening.
